        <p>If you'd like to receive information about GoCD but don't want the volume of the mailing lists this is the place
            for you. From time to time ThoughtWorks (GoCD's primary sponsor) will send out updates. This will include information
            such as...
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li> New supported release announcements </li>
            <li> Any security related announcements </li>
            <li> Learning resources</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>The volume will be extremely low, focusing on information we believe will be a real value to people using GoCD.</p>
