The goal of Continuous Delivery is to move your production release frequency from months to weeks or even days. This all sounds great, but is Continuous Delivery achievable in a complex enterprise IT environment running Java EE middleware such as WebLogic, WebSphere or JBoss?

In this deck, Andrew Phillips, VP Products, XebiaLabs and I examine the challenges of Continuous Delivery in a complex environment, the key drivers and benefits for moving to Continuous Delivery and simple ways to get started. We also demonstrate a Java EE delivery pipeline using ThoughtWorks GoCD and XebiaLabs Deployit that helps you get started and addresses the challenges commonly encountered in enterprise environments.
