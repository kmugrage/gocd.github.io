Are you using Go CD product in a cool way? Would you like to show others what you’re doing? We’d like to help out!

If you want to present a talk to a technical conference that includes usage of a Go CD product ThoughtWorks will reimburse you for reasonable travel and lodging expenses.

Your talk should be about an interesting way to solve a business or technical issue that you faced using products created by ThoughtWorks. We’re not looking for people to do product demos (and neither are event organizers).

How does it work?

- You identify an event you’d like to speak at
- Fill out the form here with the event information
- We’ll review your submission and respond within 3 business days
- You’ll need to pay for your expenses up front and then submit them for reimbursement using this form
- We’ll pay the previously agreed to amount with XXXX days of receiving your expenses
