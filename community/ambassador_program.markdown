Are you using Go CD in a cool way? Would you like to show others what you’re doing? We’d like to help!

ThoughtWorks (the creators of Go CD) is looking for people who want to talk about Go CD at technical conferences, meetups, and
anywhere else people gather to talk about DevOps and Continuous Delivery. You could be an experienced speaker, or you might be
someone who's never been in front of a crowd.

Your presentation should be about an interesting way to solve a business or technical issue using Go CD. We're not looking for
people to do product demos, and neither are event organizers.

####Some ideas...

- Continuous Delivery using container technologies like Docker and Go CD together
- Culture impact of making your build, test, and deploy process more visible

####How we can help you...

- Reimbursement of travel and lodging expenses for your event
- Mentoring and feedback during the creation of your talk
- Promoting your talk to the public

####How does it work?

- You identify an event you’d like to speak at
- Fill out the form here with the event information
- We’ll review your submission and respond within 3 business days
- You’ll pay your expenses and then submit them for reimbursement
- We’ll pay up to the previously agreed to amount with XXXX days of receiving your expenses
