<p>As part of trying to make it easier to adopt GoCD we're planning on creating a series of help videos. These videos
will be 3-5 minutes long and will focus on a single specific feature or concept.</p>

<p>We have a few ideas about topics which might be helpful based on common questions, but we'd love your feedback on which
ones we should do first. Please fill out the survey below.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
